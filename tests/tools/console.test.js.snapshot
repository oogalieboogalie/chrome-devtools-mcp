Message: issue> An element doesn't have an autocomplete attribute

A form field has an \`id\` or \`name\` attribute that the browser's autofill recognizes. However, it doesn't have an \`autocomplete\` attribute assigned. This might prevent the browser from correctly autofilling the form.

To fix this issue, provide an \`autocomplete\` attribute.

Message: issue> Ensure CORS response header values are valid

A cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) request was blocked because of invalid or missing response headers of the request or the associated [preflight request](issueCorsPreflightRequest).

To fix this issue, ensure the response to the CORS request and/or the associated [preflight request](issueCorsPreflightRequest) are not missing headers and use valid header values.

Note that if an opaque response is sufficient, the request's mode can be set to \`no-cors\` to fetch the resource with CORS disabled; that way CORS headers are not required but the response content is inaccessible (opaque).
